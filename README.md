# MediaTracker
Add movies, tv series and books to your watched, planned or ongoing lists to keep track of your media, and give ratings. Search a media item and you will get results from either IMDB or Google Books, displaying a poster or book cover, description, genre, etc. Also has a video player that will let you watch the trailer if available.

### Information
Project completed for college. Used C#, WPF and a few APIs for accessing IMDB and Google Books. Struggling to source the Database I used for the project, unfortunately. Will have to recreate it in my spare time soon.

I also unfortunately wasn't using GIT at the time (yep!), so this repo was only used to keep a copy of the final product before submission.
